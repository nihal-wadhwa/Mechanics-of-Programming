Name: <<< Nihal Wadhwa >>>

questions1.txt: points are given below for each part of each question.


1. When you first log in, what is the absolute path of your home directory?

	Write the FULL and COMPLETE command AND the answer it would print.

	:  2 points
    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	pwd
	/home/stu9/s14/nw7554

2. What command will display the contents of your current
   working directory, so that it shows the difference between
   files and directories?

	Write the FULL and COMPLETE command that would do the job.

	:  2 points
    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	ls

3. What command would you use to change your working directory from
   your home directory to an existing subdirectory named Courses?

	Write the FULL and COMPLETE command that would do the job.

	:  2 points
    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	cd Courses

4. Within the Courses subdirectory, what command would you use to
   create the subdirectory csci243.

	Write the FULL and COMPLETE command that would do the job.

	:  2 points
    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	mkdir csci243

5. When warning.c is compiled like this: gcc -o warning warning.c

   There is only 1 warning of possible problems, but there are more.

   You will have to fix this problem, but first answer parts a and b.


    a.) What 2 compiler flags always should be used to display more warnings?
    
	:  2 points
    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	-Wall -Wextra
    
    b.) There is also a 'super-picky' warning flag; what is it? 

        :  1 points
    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	-pedantic

    c.) Now it is time to start work compiling and fixing warning.c.

	Each flag, including the 'picky' flag, identifies a particular issue.

        Follow these steps. 
	DO NOT CHANGE warning.c UNTIL AFTER COMPLETING NUMBER PART c.4 below.

	1. compile warning.c using NO compiler flag options.
	2. compile warning.c with only the first warning flag added.
	3. compile warning.c with only the second warning flag added.
	4. compile warning.c with only the picky warning flag added.

	For each step:
		- IDENTIFY the flag (if any) and, in your own words,
		explain the warnings found by that flag.
		- INVESTIGATE and plan how to fix the problem.

        The format of the answer has been started for you. Fill in _______
        with the warning flag, and add your explanation on line(s) below that.

	:  4 points
    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	1. Flag: None. Explanation :No flags used
				    Issues: argument 1 of compute makes
				    integer from pointer without cast and
				    argument expected to be int not int pointer.
				    Plan: check argument to see what type is required
				    for argument in question

	2. Flag: -Wall. Explanation: Additional Issues:
				      argument missing in the main function,
				     year_offset is not initialized to be used in compute function,
				     Plan:
                                     Since both of these arguments are based off lack of
				     arguments, amending the arguments for the main function and the
				     variables should resolve the issue.
	
	3. Flag:  -Wextra . Explanation: No additional issues detected
					 argument 1 of compute makes integer from pointer without cast
					 argument missing in the main function
					 year_offset is not initialized to be used in compute function

	4. Flag:  -pedantic . Explanation: Additional Issues:
					   argument 1 of compute makes integer from pointer without cast
					   Empty array initialization not allowed,
					   neither is initialization with empty braces.
					   Plan: Since the program calls for century being an int based on
			      		   the args values, it would be best to change
					   century from being an array to an int.



    d.) Fix warning.c so it compiles without warnings and runs correctly to
	produce the output specified in the code documentation.

	:  10 points
    YOUR ANSWER IS THE SUBMITTED CODE.

	Overall, make the necessary repairs to remove warnings, and
	rewrite the code to produce the correct results.

	WAIT, THERE'S MORE! Check the returns...
	You also must fix a runtime logic error that no warning flag catches.


6. What compiler flag compiles C programs using the ISO C99 standard?

	Write only the flag value to answer this question.

	:  2 points
    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
        -std=c99
   
7. Put these steps of the compilation process into their proper order from
   first to last.

    A. Preprocess
    B. Compile
    C. Assemble
    D. Link

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
	Accidentally,reordered the the steps instead of using letters

# Mechanics-of-Programming
This is an intermediate computer science course taken in the fall semester of my sophomore year using the mid-level language C. The course introduced us to the details of program structure and the mechanics of execution as well as supportive operating system features. Security and performance issues in program design were also discussed. We also examined the program translation process.

Topics covered are as follows:
 - Language History
 - Paradigms
 - Environments
 - Modular design & development
 - Basic C & C++ (#include and #define)
 - C: Variables, data types, control flow, operators, arrays, printf, getchar, putchar
 - The OS: memory, program layout
 - C: Functions, structures, strings
 - C: Pointers and dynamic storage
 - Program maintenance
 - Program translation
 - C: Input and Output
 - C: The preprocessor
 - Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
 - Advanced features of C: bits, type qualifiers, etc.
 - The OS: System Calls and Binary Input/Output
 - The OS: Program execution, Processes and Threads
 - Performance & Security Issues

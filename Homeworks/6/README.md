<div align='center'> <h1> Homework 6: String ADT </h1>

### Description:
  In this final assignment, we were tasked to make a String abstract data type (ADT) and provide it with various functionalities like returning the length, copying strings, concantentating strings, reversing strings, extracting a substring, and getting a character at a a specific index. Since the string was designed as char *, there is also a function to destroy the string and the memory that was allocated for it.
